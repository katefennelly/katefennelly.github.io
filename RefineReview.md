# Refinement Plan:

### Software Design & Engineering:
I plan to fulfill the requirements for the ePortfolio by taking a piece of code I worked on in a previous course and adding modifications and improvements to show my coding capabilities and skills. For the first category, Software Engineering/Design, I am an artifact called Project.java, a Top 5 Destinations Java slide show from my CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle course. For my enhancement plan, I plan to convert this program into Android OS and expand the complexities by adding more buttons and more destinations and updating the program's look to be more modern. Using my skills in design interfaces, adapting Java for Android, and Object-oriented design will support these course outcomes: 
* Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science
* Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts

### Algorithms and Data Strucutures:
For the second category, Algorithms and Data Structures, I will use the same artifact, Project.java, Top 5 Destinations Java slide show from CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle course. My plan for enhancement includes improving efficiency, adding data structures, and adding an interactive part before the slideshow. For the interactive component, I will ask what their favorite type of environment is and include different button options for the end user. Each option will have a separate slide deck specific to the environment; say, you select beach, which will give the top beach destinations. Adding in these complexities will showcase my skillset and knowledge of algorithms and data structures to support the following course outcomes: 
* Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
* Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals

### Databases:
For the third category, database, I will continue with the Project.java, Top 5 Destinations Java slide show from CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle course. I will merge the project from CS-250 with my knowledge from DAD 220: Introduction to SQL to create a database for all the information within the slide show. After completing the backend of the SQL database, I will create a frontend to make it easier to add new destinations to the database for further development of the slideshow. With this development of the database, I will also attempt to add in security aspects to ensure the course outcome:
* Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources


# Code Review:
A code review is a collaborative process in software development where developers review each other â€˜s code to identify errors, assess its quality, and provide feedback. Code reviews play a vital role in catching and resolving problems early in development, leading to higher-quality software.
