# Enhancement 3 README

In this folder you will find the enhancements for the third category, Databases.

I created a Python front end for more accessible CRUD functionalities for this final enhancement. With this front end, one can look at all the data in the database, view photos associated with each entry, create new destinations, update destinations, and delete destinations. This front-end GUI allows a non-programmer to edit all sorts of information in the database without knowing SQL. 

There is no starting artifact for this enhancement.
