# Enhancement 3 README

In this folder you will find the enhancements for the third category, Databases.

I created a Python front end for more accessible CRUD functionalities for this final enhancement. With this front end, one can look at all the data in the database, view photos associated with each entry, create new destinations, update destinations, and delete destinations. This front-end GUI allows a non-programmer to edit all sorts of information in the database without knowing SQL. 

There is no starting artifact for this enhancement.

To enter the front end of the database, you will need to enter in credentials. These credentials are stored in the users table in the slideshow database, the username is stored as text and the password is stored using sha-256 hash. If the hash is a correct match to the one in the database, you can enter to the front end. 

For usage and testing of this:

username: admin
password: kate
