This artifact is the Android version of my Top Five Destinations Slideshow. The initial artifact came from my CS-250 course, and it was a basic Java program that pushed a pop-out window showing a title, description, and photo of 5 destinations. I created this app to have the same functionality. The only difference between the original Java program and the Android app is that locations are not on a loop. Once there is activity on the app, the end user can go through to the next place, and when they hit the last destination, the next button disappears, and only the previous button is available. When you return to the first location, the previous button also disappears.  

I selected this artifact in my ePortfolio because I have learned much since creating it in 2020. CS-250 was a course that I had struggled with, so having the knowledge I have now is a chance for me to excel and show how far my skills have come. Since this is a basic Java program, I can put a lot more time, detail, and complexities into it, which will show off my ability to adapt and rethink a project. Switching to a different operating system is the specific component that will showcase my skills and proficiency in software development. I improved the artifact by making it more modern by switching it to an app for Android OS.  

When enhancing and modifying this artifact, I learned there are many more depths to the Android OS. Although Android uses Java and C++ for programming, the languages are slightly different than I am used to with Windows, and it took an adjustment period. Using Android Studio has been something I enjoyed because it is a very intuitive program, which helps a lot when coding with a bunch of different variables. Going into this enhancement, I had an idea of the program I would use for these modifications but ran into trouble and could not compile it due to missing pieces. I spent a lot of time trying to get the program working and wished I had moved on to another program quicker. After switching to Android Studio, I compiled and started designing my app. As I stated earlier, Android OS differs from Java on Windows, which caused me to have some learning curves, but I overcame those. After each milestone, I received feedback, actively incorporated it, made changes as needed, and ensured that in the next milestone, it was something that I was actively addressing. My first round of feedback was that I had very limited commenting. With that feedback, I went back to improve my code for the following enhancement and added comments, and actively commented more when coding for the next part of the project. For this initial enhancement, I improved my artifact by converting it from a Java program used on Windows into an Android application with the equivalent details and information included.
