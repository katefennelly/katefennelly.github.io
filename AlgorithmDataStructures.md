The second artifact for my ePortfolio continues my work on the Top Five Destinations Slideshow. The initial artifact came from my CS-250 course, and it was a basic Java program that pushed a pop-out window showing a title, description, and photo of 5 destinations. In the first artifact, I converted the Java application to Android OS and have continued to add complexities and algorithms. For this week's enhancement, I have connected the app to a SQL database using SQLite, which now holds all data for the app, location name, description, category, type, and photo. I have added a question before a user sees the slideshow. The end user would select their favorite kind of destination, which leads to a set of locations.  

I decided on this artifact because I had limited knowledge when I made it, and now, I can convert it to Android and use a database to hold all the information in the app. Upgrading this artifact shows how far I have come throughout my educational career at SNHU. It also will show future prospective employers the skills I possess. The improvements of this artifact include adding the additional step before getting a customized slideshow deck and using my knowledge to connect the database backend.  

With this enhancement to the artifact, I planned more time to work on it, and it was a better start, but here it is later than last week, and I am finally submitting my milestone. This milestone had a lot more for me to do, so even with giving myself 4 hours after work each night and the two weekend days, it was a lot, but I accomplished a lot. Incorporating SQLite into Android Studio took longer than I had hoped, and I created an export of the SQLite database to import into the app. If I were using an actual SQL server, it would have gone more straightforward for me.
