The second artifact for my ePortfolio continues my work on the Top Five Destinations Slideshow. The initial artifact came from my CS-250 course, and it was a basic Java program that pushed a pop-out window showing a title, description, and photo of 5 destinations. In the first artifact, I converted the Java application to Android OS and have continued to add complexities and algorithms. For this week's enhancement, I have connected the app to a SQL database using SQLite, which now holds all data for the app; location name, description, category, type, and photo. I have added a question before a user sees the slideshow. The end user would select their favorite kind of destination, which leads to a set of locations.  

I decided on this artifact because I had limited knowledge when I made it, and now, I can convert it to Android and use a database to hold all the information in the app. Upgrading this artifact shows how far I have come throughout my educational career at SNHU. It also will show future prospective employers the skills I possess. The improvements of this artifact include adding the additional step before getting a customized slideshow deck and using my knowledge to connect the database backend.  

With this enhancement to the artifact, I planned more time to work on it, and it was a better start, but here it is later than last week, and I am finally submitting my milestone. This milestone had a lot more for me to do, so even with giving myself 4 hours after work each night and the two weekend days, it was a lot, but I accomplished a lot. Incorporating SQLite into Android Studio took longer than I had hoped, and I created an export of the SQLite database to import into the app. If I were using an actual SQL server, it would have been more straightforward. When I receive feedback, I find it incredibly helpful and take it all in to improve my code and coding skills. I struggled with time management and some learning curves with the first and second enhancements. The feedback given to me with this enhancement milestone was about time management and estimating time to figure out a way that better helped me. With this improvement, I created a way to incorporate user input into the app. When opening the app, the user can choose from a selection of destination categories or a random location. Depending on the user's choice, destinations by that category type will be displayed from an SQLite database.
