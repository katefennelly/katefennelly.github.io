I continued my work on the Top Five Destinations Slideshow for the third artifact. Different from the previous artifacts, I will be focusing on the database and creating a front end for the database. The initial artifact came from my CS-250 course, but this enhancement combines my DAD-220, Introduction to Structured Database Environments course, and my CS-340, Client/Server Development course. In my DAD-220 course, I learned about MySQL, and it was my first experience with a database, and in my CS-340 course, I used a MongoDB database and linked it with a Python front end, using Dash and Plotly. I created this artifact this week to make CRUD functionalities in my database easier.  

For my final computer science project, I needed to showcase my skill set, so I created an SQLite database and a Python front end using Tkinter to show my adaptability and willingness for a challenge. I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it shows my programming languages proficiency, problem-solving, and database creation and management. This artifact combines my knowledge from previous courses that I explicitly created to use with my Android application's database back end.  

Working on creating the database front end and enhancing it to fit the project's current needs proved challenging. While making the front end, I learned Tkinter, which has many uses and will be a new tool I will continue using. I faced difficulties when trying to add an image to my SQLite database and creating a way to view a picture by pulling it from the database. Fortunately, I came up with a whole new window that solved the problem of viewing the image, and with lots of research, I figured out how to write the image to the database. The feedback I received on the final enhancement was to ensure proper headers were on my code to allow for appropriate and professional communication. With that feedback, I went back and ensured that all my code had informative headings allowing another programmer to look at it and see what each piece of code does. I created a Python front end for more accessible CRUD functionalities for this final enhancement. With this front end, one can look at all the data in the database, view photos associated with each entry, create new destinations, update destinations, and delete destinations. This front-end GUI allows a non-programmer to edit all sorts of information in the database without knowing SQL.
