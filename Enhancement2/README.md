# Enhancement 2 README

In this folder you will find the enhancements for the second category, Algorithms and Data Structures. 

With this second improvement, I created a way to incorporate user input into the app. When opening the app, the user can choose from a selection of destination categories or a random location. Depending on the user's choice, destinations by that category type will be displayed from an SQLite database.
