Throughout my time at SNHU in the Computer Science program, I have learned a vast amount of information about the computer science field as well as myself and my strengths and weaknesses. Completing my coursework and developing the ePortfolio has enabled me to showcase my technical skills, project experiences, and achievements to potential employers in the computer science field. This process demonstrates my expertise and helps align my professional goals and values with the industryâ€™s demands, making me a more attractive candidate for job opportunities. Using an ePortfolio provides a tangible representation of my growth, versatility, and ability to apply knowledge to real-world projects enhancing and standing out in a competitive job market.


### 2. Refinement Plan and Code Review:

The refinement plan outlines actionable steps to address issues identified during a code review, enhancing the software's quality and maintainability. A code review is a collaborative process in software development where developers review each other's code to identify errors, assess its quality, and provide feedback.

### 3. Software Design and Engineering:

For the first artifact in my Portfolio, I took a destinations slideshow that was built in Java and ported it to Android OS.

### 4. Algorithms and Data Structures:

For the second artifact in my Portfolio, I took the base Android application created in the first artifact and added more complexities, giving the end user the choice of category for the destinations and adding all destination information into a SQLite database that connects to the application.

### 5. Databases:

The third artifact in my Portfolio is a front end interface coded in Python for the SQLite database holding all the destination information. With the front end interface, it allows for easier manipulation of data, allowing destinations to be created, read, updated, and deleted all in one place.
