## Refinement Plan and Code Review:

A code review is a collaborative process in software development where developers review each other 's code to identify errors, assess its quality, and provide feedback.
Code reviews play a vital role in catching and resolving problems early in development, leading to higher-quality software.

## Software Design and Engineering:

For the first artifact in my Portfolio, I took a destinations slideshow that was built in Java and ported it to Android OS.

## Algorithms and Data Structures:

For the second artifact in my Portfolio, I took the base Android application created in the first artifact and added more complexities, giving the end user the choice of category for the destinations and adding all destination information into a SQLite database that connects to the application.

## Databases:

The third artifact in my Portfolio is a front end interface coded in Python for the SQLite database holding all the destination information. With the front end interface, it allows for easier manipulation of data, allowing destinations to be created, read, updated, and deleted all in one place.
