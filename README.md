Throughout my time at SNHU in the Computer Science program, I have learned a vast amount of information about the computer science field as well as myself and my strengths and weaknesses. Completing my coursework and developing the ePortfolio has enabled me to showcase my technical skills, project experiences, and achievements to potential employers in the computer science field. This process demonstrates my expertise and helps align my professional goals and values with the industry’s demands, making me a more attractive candidate for job opportunities. Using an ePortfolio provides a tangible representation of my growth, versatility, and ability to apply knowledge to real-world projects enhancing and standing out in a competitive job market.

Among the many skills I learned throughout the Computer Science program, many vital topics were covered, including collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering and databases, and security. 

#### Collaborating in a Team Environment
In my CS-310: Collaboration and Team Project course, I learned how it works to develop with others, the importance of peer reviews, how to mitigate conflicts in code commits, and helpful tools like Slack to ensure everyone on the team stays up to date with all the changes happening to the code. Team collaboration is crucial for successful coding projects. 

#### Communicating with Stakeholders
Through multiple courses, I gained experience communicating with stakeholders, ensuring the product is well-rounded and meets expectations. In my CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle course, I had the opportunity to go through the different roles within the software development team, from roles like product owner, scrum master, developer, tester, etc. Communicating effectively with stakeholders is essential for project success and fosters collaboration, aligns goals, and leads to successful project outcomes. 

#### Data Structures and Algorithms
My IT-145: Foundation in Application Development and CS-260: Data Structures and Algorithms courses taught me much about data structures and algorithms. In these courses, I learned the importance of pseudocode and flowcharts when working with data structures and algorithms, allowing help with planning, visualizing, and communicating ideas before even coding. These tools help work out the process, and the visual aid helps identify errors, find ways to optimize the process, and support collaboration within teams. Along with these tools, I also learned about data structures, a fundamental of coding, which are the building blocks that allow for creating efficient, organized, and maintainable code. Data structures and algorithms work hand in hand with each other—for example, hash tables with hashing algorithms. Hash tables provide fast data retrieval by associating keys with values, and the hashing algorithms convert keys into indices, enabling quick access to stored values.

#### Software Engineering and Database
One of my first introductions to software engineering was in my IT-145: Foundation in Application Development and CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle courses. Software engineering involves designing, creating, testing, and maintaining software applications. In IT-145, I started learning the techniques and logical structure for developing an application. In CS-250, I learned more about the different roles that go into creating the product and what happens behind the scene with a customized software application—viewing how the processes work from the project owner to the scrum master to the developer and tester. Each role has a large part in the software engineering process. My first interaction with databases in this program was in the DAD-220: Introduction to Structured Database Environments course.  This course taught me about a database's primary structure and how to execute CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionalities in MySQL. After the initial database introduction, I learned more advanced database concepts and principles, allowing me to develop a client/server application in the CS-340: Client/Server Development course. I created a MongoDB database using a virtual Linux machine in this course. From there, I learned to import data from different sources, develop databases within the terminal, maneuver through databases, and create user accounts to allow for authentication. The second half of this course involved creating a Python front end that allows for easier data manipulation from the client side.

#### Security
Security is a critical topic in programming and a significant component of software development. Security has also been a well-known topic in Computer Science and was mentioned first in my CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance course. In CS-320, I worked with software engineering testing strategies and practices as part of the software development lifecycle. Certain aspects of the testing, like verification and validation, were my first breath of security to be mindful of. As I advanced in my courses, secure coding practices were slowly taught in the lessons by my professors and shown to be a necessary and powerful tool. In my CS-340: Client/Server Development course, I worked on creating authentication and permissions for different database users and how those translate into a GUI front end.


In my ePortfolio, I will showcase my Software Design and Engineering, Algorithm and Data Structures, and Databases skills. For these three categories, we are to pick an artifact from our previous coursework and enhance it to ensure we fully grasp the course outcomes from the Computer Science program at SNHU. I have chosen one artifact for these three categories I will use across the board. The artifact I will use to showcase my skills is a Top 5 Destinations slide show from my CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle course. This program is a simplistic Java program for Windows that shows five different destinations. This original artifact shows the name, photo, and brief description of the destination with two buttons, next and previous, allowing you to go through the five locations continuously. This artifact will assist in showcasing the complete spectrum of my skills and capabilities as I take a piece of work from an earlier course and enhance it to aid in illustrating the progression achieved through the computer science program.

## Refinement Plan and Code Review:

The refinement plan outlines actionable steps to address issues identified during a code review, enhancing the software's quality and maintainability. A code review is a collaborative process in software development where developers review each other's code to identify errors, assess its quality, and provide feedback.

## Software Design and Engineering:

For the first artifact in my Portfolio, I took a destinations slideshow that was built in Java and ported it to Android OS.

## Algorithms and Data Structures:

For the second artifact in my Portfolio, I took the base Android application created in the first artifact and added more complexities, giving the end user the choice of category for the destinations and adding all destination information into a SQLite database that connects to the application.

## Databases:

The third artifact in my Portfolio is a front end interface coded in Python for the SQLite database holding all the destination information. With the front end interface, it allows for easier manipulation of data, allowing destinations to be created, read, updated, and deleted all in one place.
